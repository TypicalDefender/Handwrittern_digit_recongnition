# Handwrittern_digit_recongnition
This is most suitable and simple way to train the handwritten digits using python. I have used decision tree classifier in my case. You can use k-nearest neighbour or random forest machine learning algorithm.
In this case the accuracy is 100% and it has been achieved by training and loading more data.
